Last Alert

[Description]
Our project is a game called last alert. The genre is a timed scavenger hunt/escape game where you have to find objects in the scenes and bring them to an area while solving little puzzles along the way. For themes and settings we decided on having the game take place on a space station. The motive behind finding the objects is that there is a meteor on couse to hit the station. The player must find objects in the space station to finish the escape pod to escape before the time is up.
